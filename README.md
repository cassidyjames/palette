## View and copy colors from the elementary brand palette

elementary uses a set of bright and friendly colors. Easily access the entire palette on your local device, see examples of usage, and copy any variation of each color to paste into your own projects.

## Made for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io)

Palette is designed and developed on and for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io). Purchasing through AppCenter directly supports the development and ensures instant updates straight from me. Get it on AppCenter for the best experience.

Versions of Palette may have been built and made available elsewhere by third-parties. These builds may have modifications or changes and **are not provided nor supported by me**. The only supported version is distributed via AppCenter on elementary OS.

## Developing and Building

If you want to hack on and build Palette yourself, you'll need the following dependencies:

* libgee-0.8-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* meson
* valac

Run `meson build` to configure the build environment and run `ninja test` to build and run automated tests

    meson build --prefix=/usr
    cd build
    ninja test

To install, use `ninja install`, then execute with `com.github.cassidyjames.palette`

    sudo ninja install
    com.github.cassidyjames.palette
